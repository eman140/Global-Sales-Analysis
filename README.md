This project analyzes a financial dataset to uncover insights, trends, and provide actionable recommendations for business improvement.

## Project Description

This project involves exploring, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a financial dataset using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis focuses on identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), understanding relationships between variables, and visualizing findings to communicate insights effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "Financial Sample.xlsx", containing information about sales, profit, customer segments, products, countries, and discounts.
